## Project Description
RagInABox aims to be a configurable, end-to-end RAG starter kit. It should be able to ingest local folders, scrape websites (including linked files like PDFs), chunk the content, and store it in a vector database (Azure AI Search by default). A Gradio frontend provides the chat interface, with Azure OpenAI GPT5.2 as the default LLM and text-embedding-3-small for embeddings. All keys and URLs are supplied via a `.env` file.
